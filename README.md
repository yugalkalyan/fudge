The guide below will help you build an APK (Android Package) for Android devices. Please note that creating an iOS app requires a developer account with Apple, and this process is not covered here.

Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

Flutter SDK: Install Flutter.
Android Studio: Set up an Android development environment.

git clone https://github.com/yugalkalyan/fudge.git

open the project in android studio

use the below commands in terminal for making android build:-

1. flutter pub get
2. flutter build apk

The APK will be in build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/.

Installing the APK:

Transfer the APK file to your Android device or emulator and install it.

Note on iOS App Development:

Building an iOS app requires an Apple developer account. Due to Apple's proprietary nature, iOS development details are not covered here. Refer to the official Flutter documentation and Apple's guidelines for iOS development.
